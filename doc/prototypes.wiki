#summary HP 6038A Front Panel Prototypes

== TTL Prototype ==

This was an attempt at recreating the HP 6038A front panel from
the schematic in the service manual.

The RPG encoder was a low cost
[http://www.grayhill.com/catalog/Opt_Encoder_62P.pdf Grayhill 62P series],
16 detents per revolution, with a built in pushbutton switch.
The pushbutton was used to select between voltage and current adjust.
Although it worked, this RPG did not have sufficient resolution and it
took many turns to make adjustments.

The service manual schematic had the LED segments
assigned to the wrong shift register bits.
The correct wiring was deduced through trial and error and is
presented in the [design Design] wiki page.

Due to space on the proto board, the 5 segment LED for AMPS was omitted.

The board attached to the power supply via ribbon cable to the GPIB board,
routed out through the back of the unit.

In retrospect, the board layout was attrocious and a front panel connected
to the main power supply unit via ribbon cable was unusable.
The finished product found a nice home in a garage cupboard.
A better plan would have been to invest in a protoboard that could be
cut to fit inside the case instead of using available scrap.

== PIC Prototype ==

It seemed like a fun challenge to reduce the above to a single chip
PIC design that could be built into the power supply case, and
be constructed with much less effort.

The PIC includes an SPI peripheral that seemed to map well to
HP's shift register design for the front panel.  Further, it includes
an _interrupt on change_ feature for four I/O port pins that seemed useful
for interfacing to the RPG.  Interfacing PIC's to LCD's and pushbuttons
is straightforward.

First it was necessary to build a prototype to see if it could work,
and to get the firmware developed.  This prototype was based on:

 * PIC MPLAB ICD demo board (already had)
 * [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39582b.pdf 16F873A PIC]
 * scrap protoboard with five pushbutton switches and pullups on it
 * [http://www.avagotech.com/docs/5988-5851EN Avago HRPC-AD32] RPG with 32 detents per revolution
 * [http://www.winstar.com.tw/products_detail_ov.php?ProID=32 Winstar WH2002A] 2x20 LCD display ([http://ouwehand.net/~peter/lcd/lcd.shtml Hitachi HD44780] compatible).

Added to the MPLAB board were two ribbon connectors wired in parallel so
the TTL front panel could be used in parallel (with the PIC's DATA_UP
line in tri-state) for debugging the receive/LCD portion of the firwmare.
The MPLAB board was set up to draw power from the HP ribbon cable.

== Final Prototype ==

This is the final prototype, built into the HP 6038A.
