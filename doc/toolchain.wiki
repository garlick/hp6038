#summary Tool Chain

== C Compiler ==

The project is compiled down to Intel hex using
[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en542849 HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs] on Linux.
The Lite version is a fully functional but non-optimized free download.

== Programmer ==

The hex object is passed to the Warp 13a programmer
attached to a USB to RS-232 converter using
[http://home.pacbell.net/theposts/picmicro/ picp] on Linux.

== To build ==

Download the firmware release tarball and do the following.  If you don't
plan to recompile, you don't need to install picc as a compiled
executable is included in the tarball.

After you extract the tarball, examine the Makefile and edit for your
PIC part, clock rate, and pcip serial port, then with pic programmer live
and part in the programmer socket:

 make pgm

Transplant the chip into your wired board and you're good to go!
